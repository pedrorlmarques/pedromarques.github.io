**Hello,**

Thanks for visiting my blog! 
My name is Pedro Marques I'm working as Java Developer for 5 years.
Programming is also my hobby.
I love Spring Framework, so all my post will be around the Spring and Java Ecosystem.
I like to learn new technologies and be up-to-date with the latest trends.

I decided to create this blog to have some fun and also to share my knowledge here in a way that everyone can understand.

You may want to contact me you can [email me](mailto:pedrorlmarques@gmail.com) or find me in [LinkedIn](https://pt.linkedin.com/public-profile/in/pedro-marques-a61b959a).
